# hidden-search-button

4/50: 
This is the fourth of fifty projects, that i will be doing in the next 50 days.
The idea is to use html, css and vanilla javascript to improve my skills.

In this project I created a hidden search button that reveals a hidden input field, with a focus, in a smooth transition, when clicked.
